DTANet: Dual Token Attention Network for Medical Ultrasound Image Segmentation.

![Graphical Abstract](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be322646-aa21-4364-bb35-0fe7241e4389)
The Dual Token Attention Network (DTANet) integrates Global and Local Tokens within a lightweight attention framework, enhancing both global context and local detail extraction. Combined with multi-scale skip connections and refinement blocks, DTANet achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in ultrasound image segmentation across diverse datasets.
